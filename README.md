## Notes about the Projects
### Finance Scraper
The finance scraper uses raw HTML webscraping of [Yahoo Finance's website](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup) using user-inputted tickers. With this information, the scraper constructs a dataframe of key financial data. The project uses [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape the websites and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to handle the data manipulation.
