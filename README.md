## Notes about the Projects

### Opioid Project

The opioid project is mainly a demonstration of preprocessing techniques. It also contains basic models of the data to try to predict Adverse Opioid Events given a variety of other data.

### Finance Scraper

The finance scraper uses raw HTML webscraping of [Yahoo Finance's website](https://finance.yahoo.com/lookup) using user-inputted tickers. With this information, the scraper constructs a dataframe of key financial data. The project uses [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape the websites and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to handle the data manipulation.
